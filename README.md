# Essential Guidelines

For hosting options other than the ones provided, such as [IPFS Deployment](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmfGUuMzLqHyAybnUsPG6aMwQ241V6Q69AmPxCWsVsTDcD) or [Vercel Deployment](https://tally-zero-preview.vercel.app/), we suggest visiting [Web3Modal](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in) to establish a new project. Subsequently, create a `.env` or `.env.local` file, or input it as an environment variable in your hosting provider. Ensure the naming convention is `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3STORAGE_PROJECT_ID`.

The project's pages are located in the `/app` directory, with components organized as follows:

- `container`: Components related to the interface
- `form`: All forms are housed here
- `navigation`: Components associated with the layout
- `section`: Components for the marketing page
- `table`: Self explanatory
- `ui`: Components from [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

The `/config` folder is crucial for maintenance purposes:

- `chains.ts`: Contains all chains for Web3Modal connection
- `data.ts`: Lists the chains supported by Tally Zero (refer to the image). You can add as many as required.

Lastly, the `/data` folder contains the ABI for TallyZero.
